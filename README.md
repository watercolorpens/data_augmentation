# Physically rational data augmentation and validation
Code for the papaer of **Physically rational data augmentation for energy consumption estimation of electric vehicles**
## Overview
The physically rational data augmentation and validation is a Python-based program designed to realize the data augmentation of the vehicle driving data in real world. This tool through sample split and sample concatenation of any driving data achieved data augmentation and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in existing energy consumption estimation models.

## Features
- **Sample Feature Extraction**: Extract sample features from raw trip data.
- **Proposed method for data augmentation**: The proposed data augmentation method is used to amplify the original sample data.
- **Baseline method for data augmentation**: Two existing data augmentation methods to amplify raw sample data.
- **Random Search Parameter Adjustment**: Stochastic search is utilized to achieve the tuning of the hyperparameters of each energy estimation model under the same parameter space.
- **Five fold cross validation**: Existing energy estimation models are trained using augmented data to validate the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation method under five-fold cross-validation conditions.
